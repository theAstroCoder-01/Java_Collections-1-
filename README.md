# Java_Collections-1-

1. First_ArrayList
  
  — Program that creates an ArrayList of integers, adds 10 random integer to it sort the list, and then print the sorted list.

2. Second_HashSetUniqueness
  
  — Program that creates a HashSet of strings, adds some strings to it (including duplicates), and then prints the set to show that it contains only unique       elements.

3. Third_TreeMapSortedKeys

  — Program that creates a TreeMap` with integer keys and string values. It adds several key-value pairs and prints the map to show that it is sorted by keys.

4. Fourth_LinkedListOperations

  — Program that creates a LinkedList of strings, adds some strings, inserts a string at a specific position, removes a string, and prints the list.

5. Fifth_PriorityQueuewithCustomObjects

  — Program that creates a 'PriorityQueue' of a custom class 'Person' where 'Person' has a name and age. The program implements 'Comparable' in the 'Person' class to sort by age. It adds some 'Person' objects to the queue and print them.

6. Sixth_VectorSynchronization

  —  Program that creates a 'Vector' of doubles, adds some elements, and performs operations like removing an element and inserting at a specific position. 
It prints the vector after each operation.

7. Seventh_StackOperations
  
  — Program that creates a 'Stack' of integers, pushes several integers onto the stack, pops an integer, and prints the stack's state before and after popping.

8. Eigth_HashMapIteration
  
  — Pogram that creates a 'HashMap' with string keys and integer values. It adds several key-value pairs and iterate over the entries using both keySet and entrySet.

9. Ninth_CollectionsUtilityMethods
  
  — Program that uses 'Collections' utility methods to reverse and shuffle a list. Create an 'ArrayList', add some elements, and apply these methods.

10. Tenth_UsingLinkedHashMapforOrder
  
  — Program that create a 'LinkedHashMap' with string keys and integer values. It adds several key-value pairs and print the map to show that it maintains the insertion order.
